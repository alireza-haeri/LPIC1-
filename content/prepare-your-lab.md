# Prepare your Lab

Watching videos or even reading books is never enough. You need to have Linux installed and practice your newly acquired knowledge. As you may know, LPIC is a
distro agnostic
test and an LPIC-certified guru should be able to work in any GNU/Linux system, or at least on the major ones. Because of this, I suggest you have two Linux machines which you can work on. One RPM-based and one Debian-based.
One common way is to use a Virtual Machine. You can install something like
VirtualBox
(for Win/Linux and Intel Macs) or
UTM
(for M1 Macs) or any other solution to install your test machines in a Virtual Machine.
For your distribution, I suggest
Ubuntu
or
Debian
as your Debian-based system and
Fedora
or
Rocky Linux
as your RPM-based machine. Feel free to install anything else and do whatever you enjoy!
If you want to walk in my steps, do a normal GUI installation. Here is me, installing the Ubuntu 22.04:
And here, you can follow the Fedora 36 installation:
Note: The version is not that important. Here I'm installing Fedora 36 & Ubuntu 22.04.
